Pulverizer recursively traverses all html (or other markup) files and replaces <script> and <style> references within them with a minified and gzipped equivalent.

Pulverizer is to the 'H5BP Build Tool' what Aspirin is to a scalpel. Sometimes, all you need is Aspirin.

If you need a scalpel go to html5boilerplate.com
