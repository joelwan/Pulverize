# Pulverize

Pulverize recursively traverses all html (or other markup) files and replaces \<script\> and \<style\> references 
within them with combined and minified equivalents.

Pulverize is to the 'H5BP Build Tool' what Aspirin is to a scalpel. Sometimes, all you need is Aspirin.

If you need a scalpel go to [html5boilerplate.com](http://html5boilerplate.com)
